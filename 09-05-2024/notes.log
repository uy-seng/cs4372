recap about previous class
lesson review
    cover topic such as
        root node   
        impurity 

    impurtiy meansure:
        entropy
        gini index
    
    impurity is always calculated on the target variable (for classification, it will be on the class variable)

    after we calculate impurity for the target,
    we will check each of the n features, find the lowest entropy at the child level
    get information gain
        IG_x1 =  H - H'
        IG_x2 .........
                |
                |
                |
        IG_xn ..........


how to compute entropy
    suppose that we have n class
    for every class i, we compute p_i where p_i is the probability of class i occuring
    then we do -1 * sum(p_i)log_2(p_i)

how to calculate gini index
    1 - sum(p_i^2)

high entropy = lots of class mixture
low entropy = less class mixture
